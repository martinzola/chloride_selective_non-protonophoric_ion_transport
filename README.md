# Files needed to run the MD simulations:

GAFF parameters (.top files) as well as starting geometries (.gro files) for transporters 1 and 2 are located in the MD/topology subdirectory. Final frames of the membrane simulations of 1 and 2 with each complex, as well as their simulations in DMSO are available in the MD/final subdirectory. MD parameters used to run the simulations are located in the MD/parameters subdirectory. 

# Files needed to reproduce the DFT calculations:

All of the final optimised structures (.xyz files) from DFT calculations can be found in the DFT/optimised subdirectory.
